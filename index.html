          <p>
            At my core, I'm an anaylst and problem solver. Unfortunatley for me,
            it's not applied to only one thing. On the contrary, I anaylize
            everything.
          </p>

          
          <ul><p>I'm a:</p>
            <li>
              computer scientist who loves designing systems, like lego conrtucts
              and rub-golberg machince of my youth;
            </li>
            <li>
              philosphy, who's dedicated to understanding the human condition;
            </li>
            <li>
              artist, a comedian & tragedian who's always looking for the next
              joke;
            </li>
            <li>
              guy whose going to grow in all aspect of life, because it'll
              bother me if I don't.

            Such a strong personality is a double egde sword, indeed I've been
            told I'm an over thinker, but think that means I just haven't
            thought enough. With time I've tempered myself, mastery of the self
            is after all another thing on the To Do List.

            I've dedicated myself to writing a book. I did it, and now I have to
            write a sequel, perhaps more. The point of this project was
            to commit and finish a large artistic endeavour; there can be no
            retreat, the story will be finished unless I die first.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've graduated with my degree, finally, and now I look to start me career.
             My feild is very broad and very deep, and I'm interested in almost everything.
             Let the massive lifestyle changes begin.
