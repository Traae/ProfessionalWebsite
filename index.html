          <h3 class="headingFont">About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a recent graduate, looking for a start on my career. Born and raised in Pocatello Idaho, I'm hoping to carve out a life that allows me to utilize my skills and stay with my family.
          </p>
          <p>I chose a degree in Computer Science for one reason, I needed to choose and I took a bunch of coding classes in high school. Of Course I wanted to make a video game, and still do, but professionally I'm more concerned about having work that engages my problem solving skills in a sustainable way.</p>
          <p>I have a minor in philosophy, and I'll certainly use it. I write and read in my free time. While not the skill set I'm currently acting upon, if an opportunity presented itself, I wouldn't be opposed to working on more abstract things.</p>
          <ul><p>In regards to work, I:</p>
            <li>
              care about quality for its own sake;
            </li>
            <li>
              am driven to accomplish my goal;
            </li>
            <li>
              am conscientious of the project scope and my team's work.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My personality can have some pitfalls, but life experience has tempered me.
          </p>

        <p id="currentStatus">
          <h3 class="headingFont">Currently</h3>
          <p>
            Luckily, I'm not pinned down to a single interest in my field, but this also means I have no idea what tools and skills would be best to study at the moment. Thus, I'm trying a little bit of everything.
