        <h3 class="headingFont">About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a recent graduate, looking for a start on my career. I'm hoping to
          carve out a life that let's me grow my skills and use my talents.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose a degree in Computer Science to exercie my inner engineer.
          Professionally I'm looking to engage my problem solving skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a minor in philosophy, and I'll certainly use it. I write and
          read in my free time. While not the skill set I'm currently acting on,
          if an opportunity presented itself I wouldn't be opposed to working on
          more abstract things.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>In regards to work:</p>
          <li>I care about quality for its own sake.</li>
          <li>I am driven to accomplish my goal.</li>
          <li>I am conscientious of the project scope and my team's work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I'm not perfect, but I'm always working to improve at everything. I do
          mean everything, I'm been trying to find the optimal oats and yogurt
          breakfast for the past month. Little experiments and iterations can
          lead to big results over time.
        </p>
        <h3 class="headingFont">Currently</h3>
        <p>
          Luckily, I'm not pinned down to a single interest in my field, but
          this also means I have no idea what tools and skills would be best to
          study at the moment. Thus, I'm trying a little bit of everything.
