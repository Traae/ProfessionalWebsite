# GitHub Page

A repo for a personal professional website, and a web dev practice project.
I decided to scale back the project into something more basic and finish it up using the github pages feature.
This way I can work on more practice projects and develop more diverse features.

## Features

- A short bio.
- A link to my:
- - github
- - linkedIn
- - resume
- - diploma

And a link back to this source code.

## To Do

I think my code could be cleaned up a little, but I'm not to versed on webdev standard practices.
