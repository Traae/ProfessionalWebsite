# ProfessionalWebsite

A repo for a personal professional website. Partially a web dev practices project.

## Features

The site will need to have:

- A Readable Design:
  - easy navigation,
  - simple design, Desktop and Mooble
  - well formated with modern web dev techniques,
  - pleasant colors.
- Pages should include:
  - Landign page with a quick bio, (Maybe include contact info here.)
  - A work History and sample resume,
  - A CV / Story page,
  - A Portfolio Page for Major Skills,
  - A page denoting minor or hobbie skills.

## TO DO

Roughly in the order I should do it:

CHANGE OF PLANS

I don't really care about making some extravagent website for myself, I'd rather learn stuff through smaller or more usefull projects.

With this in mind:

- Figure out how to do the lay I want (easy)
- make it all relative to the screen size and have a min and max (easy-med)
- Write some words about myself (hard)
- set up a download link for my resume (easy?)
- set up links to other places (easy)
- get it up and hosted (easy???)
