# GitHub Page

A repo for a personal professional website. Partially a web dev practices project.
I decided to scalle back the project into something more basic and finish it up usign the github pages feature.

The repo has been renamed, and and I'm just going to get it done, even if it's not pretty. This is my first website after all.
